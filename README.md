# Quantum-computing-codes

This repo consists of various codes using Qiskit module in python to practice quantum computing. each file shows a begineer level code to understand basics of QC as well as Qiskit.

Basic State vector representation: shows the creatiion of basic quantum states in qiskit.

Circuit Identitites: creates basic QC circuits using qubits and runs basic algorithms.

Phase Kickback: Implements phase kickback on the different quantum states.

Implementation of multiple qubit: Multiple qubit circuits and algorithms are implemented.
